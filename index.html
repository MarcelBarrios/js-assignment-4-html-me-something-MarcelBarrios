               <h2>Montreux, Switzerland</h2>
               <p>Montreux is a very small city and I cannot say that it has the beauty that we are used to seeing in ancient European cities. Montreux is more modern than historical. Usually my main criterion for evaluating a city is whether I want to return? So you want to come back to Montreux again and again, or even better - stay here for a while.</p>

               <h2>Aruba</h2>
               <p>Inspired by Dutch Colonial architecture with a Caribbean twist, downtown’s magical, vibrant and colorful scenery will have you exploring all the extensive selection of shops and long and stretched walkway downtown has to offer. For those looking to rest and sit down, hop on the free trolley that travels through downtown and still get to explore everything it has to offer.</p>

               <h2>Madeira, Portugal</h2>
               <p>There is much less to do than in Lisbon at least culturally speaking. Downtown is nice, it has a couple of good discos and lots of bars and restaurants, there's a lot of hiking paths to explore in the island. Normally people your age generally spend weekends on some friends house having parties, drinking, playing some poker, flirting and all that jazz. A lot of people own a "vivenda" with a pool even if they aren't rich (1990s boom was a fun time). You need a car to live in Funchal, everything is too far apart and the bus take a lot of time and aren't very practical on a day to day basis. There's some concerts and live bands all year round but nothing on the level of Lisbon.</p>

               <h2>Vancouver, Canada</h2>
               <p>Unlike many large cities around the world, Vancouver has no must see museum, or manmade structure, or tallest anything. Rather the whole city is one giant example of Mother Nature and humans coexisting peaceably with one another. You won't love Vancouver unless you've stayed there for awhile in one of its many cool, quirky neighborhoods and sampled the flavors they have to offer. Each neighborhood has its own unique set of stores, yummy restaurants, green parks, and lots of outdoor activities to enjoy.

               <h2>Bogota, Colombia</h2>
               <p>Ten million people call vibrant, passionate, sprawling Bogota home. The energy of this metropolitan heart of Colombia is in part fueled by its hundreds of eclectic and authentic dining hot spots, fantastic wines, and frequent foodie festivals. Ask the locals where they like to eat, then walk off your empanadas and aji with a stroll through the historic district of La Candelaria or during an indulgent shopping adventure on the North Side.</p>
